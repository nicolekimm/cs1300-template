        For this project, I observed users interacting with a Balmuda toaster oven. 
        I interviewed the same users regarding their individual experiences, and 
        based on the patterns in their responses, I developed two user personas.
        Creating these personas allowed me to not only empathize with users 
        but also understand how different people interact with the same interface.
        Finally, I created a storyboard for one of these personas to depict a 
        journey that a user may take when interacting with this toaster oven.

            Balmuda is a steam-based toaster oven that toasts and bakes 
            anything from bread and pizza to sweet potatoes and chocolate chip cookies. 
            It is currently sitting in my kitchen. 
          </div>
          <div id="components-description">
            There are three main components for this interface: 
            the setting knob, the water lid, and the time knob. 
            The setting knob sets the oven to a particular toasting
            or baking mode, the water lid holds up to 5ccs of water
            and allows the Balmuda to turn into a steam oven, and the
            time knob sets the toasting and baking time.

          Key Observations:
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="box2">
        <div id="p">
          Before conducting interviews and crafting user personas, 
          I observed three users interacting with the Balmuda toaster oven. 
          My three users were my mom, dad, and sister. Because the Balmuda is located in my kitchen,
          it made the most sense to observe them. They also best represent the interface’s user population 
          as a whole since both teens and adults use the toaster oven to make easy and delicious meals. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Through my observations, I noticed that each user has a different process
          for setting up the toaster oven. For instance, one user pushed the ON/OFF
          button before pouring water into the water lid. Another user placed a slice
          of bread in the oven before pouring water and pushing the ON/OFF button. 
          The third user turned the setting knob before doing anything else. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Furthermore, I observed users hesitating with the setting knob and the time knob.
          One user put a bagel in the toaster oven, looked at the different toasting settings,
          and took a few seconds to decide between the toast mode and the croissant mode. 
          Another user put a pizza in the oven, turned the setting knob to pizza mode, looked at
          the time knob, and fiddled with it for a couple seconds before leaving it at ten minutes. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Finally, I observed that each user has a different preference for the amount of water that
          goes in the water lid. Even though the “standard” amount of water is 5ccs, one user did
          not put any water in the water lid. Another user poured a little less than 5ccs of water.

        <div id="p">
          After observing the users, I asked them questions regarding their experiences with the toaster oven. 
        </div>
        <ol id="p">
          <li>On a scale of 1-10, rate the level of difficulty in using the different settings in the oven. 
            In this scale, 1 means “not difficult at all” and 10 means “very difficult.” 
          </li>
          <li>In a week, how often do you find yourself putting food back in the oven after the first round? 
          </li>
          <li>How do you feel when you toast a new kind of food in the oven?
          </li>
          <li>What kinds of food do you expect the oven to toast?
          </li>
          <li>Is there a reason why you choose a certain setting for a food that can be toasted under multiple settings?

          Interview Summaries:
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="box2">
      <div id="p">
        For the first question, one user rated the level of difficulty as 5 
        and the other two users rated it as 4. Two users commented that they 
        didn’t know what the difference was between toast mode and croissant mode. 
        All users remarked that they didn’t know which mode to use when the food 
        they were toasting was neither toast, pizza, nor croissant. 
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        For the second question, one user commented that they never put the food back in the oven 
        after the first round. This user noted that the food was sometimes cold when the oven was 
        finished but that he was too lazy to reheat it. Another user noted that she puts the food 
        back at least twice a week, mainly due to the fact that she underestimates 
        the time it would take to toast the food. Finally, the last user said she puts the food back about once a week and this is also because 
        of the same reason as the second user. 
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        For the third question, one user remarked that she feels excited when she toasts 
        a new kind of food in the oven. She said that the Balmuda is surprising: 
        sometimes, it makes the food soft, and at other times, it makes the food soggy 
        due to the added water. In other words, it is a hit or miss. The other two users 
        noted that they feel somewhat anxious when they toast a new kind of food in the oven 
        because they never know what to expect. This is similar to the first user’s response 
        except that instead of feeling excited for the uncertain, these users feel anxious. 
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        For the fourth question, one user answered that he expects the oven to toast anything 
        bread-related, as well as anything that can be baked. Another user replied that she 
        doesn’t really know because the only thing she has tried toasting is pizza and toast. 
        Finally, the last user said, “Anything!”
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        For the fifth question, one user said she doesn’t think too much about the different settings. 
        She said that she looks at the pictures of the different modes and chooses a mode that looks 
        the most like the food she is toasting. For instance, when she toasts a bagel, 
        she chooses the toast mode because the bagel looks most like toast. The other two users 
        noted that they choose the mode that the oven is already set on. They don’t bother changing 
        the mode based on the food. Instead, they leave the mode as it is and either add more or 
        less water depending on the current mode.

      </div>
      <div id="box2">
        <div id="p">
          Based on the responses from the user interviews, I crafted two different user personas. 
        </div>
        <img id="persona" src="busy natalie.jpg">
        <div id="p2">
          Natalie is a junior at Brown University. 
          As someone who wakes up late and has little time 
          to make breakfast, she often faces issues with 
          choosing the right toasting setting because she does 
          not have time to read the instruction manual. 
          As a result, she often chooses the wrong toaster 
          setting and burns her food. Based on user interviews, 
          Natalie represents a user of the chosen interface because 
          there are users who also don’t quite understand what each toaster 
          setting is for but does not have the time to research and learn. 
          She represents a user who needs to make fast meals, 
          and thus, uses the Balmuda for convenience. 
        </div>
        <img id="persona" src="caring claire.jpg">
        <div id="p2">
          Claire is a 40 year old bank teller. She is also a wife and mom to three kids,
          and her life mainly revolves around her work and her kids. One of her main issues
          with the interface is that it is not big enough. Because she has a large family,
          she cooks big meals. However, the Balmuda is small, and as a result, she finds herself
          using the toaster oven at least twice to make one meal. Another problem is the time knob. 
          As someone who uses the Balmuda to cook new foods, Claire sometimes does not know how 
          long she should leave the food in the toaster oven. She has not been able to find clear instructions online. 
          Claire represents a user of the chosen interface because there are users that use the Balmuda to prepare meals
          for their family and have the same issues that Claire is facing.

          This project made me realize the importance of empathizing with users. 
          It also taught me that design is complex; it is difficult to create a design 
          that accommodates each user. Nevertheless, by being open to different and new perspectives, 
          it becomes easier to brainstorm and create designs that don’t just accommodate one “stereotypical”
          user but rather a range of diverse users.
